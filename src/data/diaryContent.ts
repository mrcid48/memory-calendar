Those cold January nights became our favorite — we'd bundle up, make hot chocolate, and dream about all the adventures ahead. Every frozen morning felt magical because I woke up next to you.",

We cooked together, laughed at our failed heart-shaped pancakes, and slow-danced in the kitchen. The snow kept falling outside, but inside, we were warm and wonderfully in love.",
